# Introduction
The UN have Sustainable Development Goals.
One of which is to reduce waste (SDG12?)
However another is to increase human prosperity (SDGX?)
A measure of prosperity if Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

What is the relationship between GDP and household waste?
One theory would be that increased GDP is linked to an increase in consumerism, and so a positive correlation would be expected.
On the other hand, high GDP usually means a country has more money to spend on infrastructure, hence a higher recycling rate would be expected and thus a negative correlation would be expected.
